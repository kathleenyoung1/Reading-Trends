# Reading-Trends

I started reading Marcus Aurelius last spring. I'd never had much interest in philosophy, but I was desperate to find a way of managing the stress of isolating in my apartment while the pandemic raged through New York City. I wasn't sleeping much, and I was open to any wisdom that might help. So I gave philosophy a try.  

I didn't make it to a state of stoic acceptance. It turns out I don't like philosophy books. But I did start to wonder whether there might be others who were reacting to the pandemic by reading in an entirely new way. What do we read in a pandemic? Philosophy? Light entertainment? Cookbooks? Divorce manuals? I was very curious, so I started this project.
